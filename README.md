Steps
1. Open Power BI
Begin by launching Power BI, ensuring you have the necessary version installed.

2. Load the Dataset
Load the provided dataset into Power BI. Include detailed instructions on how to import the dataset, specifying file format and location.

3. Transform Data and Remove Anomalies
Perform data transformation to ensure the dataset is clean and free of anomalies. Clearly outline the steps taken to clean the data, including any specific transformations or filters applied.

4. Use Star Schema for Mapping Tables
Implement a star schema by mapping tables using common columns. Explain the rationale behind choosing the star schema and detail the relationships established between the tables.

5. DAX Implementation
a. Calculated Columns
Utilize Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns. Clearly define the purpose and logic behind each calculated column, highlighting their significance in the analysis.

b. Measures
Implement DAX measures to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Explain the rationale behind choosing specific measures and their relevance to the hospitality domain.

6. Dashboard Creation
